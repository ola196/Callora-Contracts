# Access Control

## 1. Vault Access Control

### Overview
The Callora Vault implements role-based access control for deposit operations to ensure only authorized parties can increase the vault balance.

### Roles
- **Owner**: Set during contract initialization. Exclusive authority to manage allowed depositors and withdraw funds.
- **Allowed Depositor**: Addresses approved by the owner to handle automated deposits.
- **Authorized Caller**: Optional address permitted to trigger `deduct` operations.
- **Admin**: Authority over `distribute`, `set_settlement`, `set_revenue_pool`, and admin rotation.

### Distribute Semantics

The `distribute` function allows admins to move **untracked on-ledger surplus** USDC to arbitrary recipients.

**Key Behaviors:**
- Checks actual token balance, NOT `meta.balance`
- Useful for recovering funds that exist on-ledger but aren't tracked internally
- **Allowed when paused** — matches `withdraw` policy for emergency recovery

**Pause Policy Rationale:**
`distribute` is intentionally exempt from pause checks because it serves as an emergency recovery tool. Admins may need to move untracked surplus funds during a circuit-breaker event, similar to how owners can use `withdraw` to recover tracked funds while paused.

### Authorization Matrix

| Function | Owner | Admin | Allowed Depositor | Authorized Caller | Others |
|----------|-------|-------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|
| `deposit` | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `withdraw` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `withdraw_to` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `distribute` | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `deduct` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `batch_deduct` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `set_settlement` | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `set_revenue_pool` | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

### Pause Behavior

| Function | Blocked when paused? |
|----------|---------------------|
| `deposit` | Yes |
| `deduct` | Yes |
| `batch_deduct` | Yes |
| `withdraw` | No (emergency recovery) |
| `withdraw_to` | No (emergency recovery) |
| `distribute` | No (emergency recovery of untracked surplus) |
| `set_settlement` | No (admin config) |
| `set_revenue_pool` | No (admin config) |

## 2. Settlement Access Control

### Overview
The Callora Settlement contract tracks individual developer balances and global protocol revenue. It enforces strict access control for incoming payments and administrative updates.

### Roles
- **Admin**: Primary authority over contract configuration and sensitive data.
- **Vault**: The registered vault contract authorized to send payments.
- **Pending Admin**: Nominee awaiting acceptance of the admin role.

### Authorization Matrix

| Function | Admin | Vault | Pending Admin | Others |
|----------|-------|-------|---------------|--------|
| `receive_payment` | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `set_admin` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `accept_admin` | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `set_vault` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `get_all_developer_balances` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

### Security Model
- **Two-Step Admin Rotation**: Prevents accidental loss of control by requiring the nominee to explicitly accept the role.
- **Restricted Views**: Sensitive batch queries like `get_all_developer_balances` are restricted to the admin to prevent unnecessary exposure of the full ledger via the contract interface.

## Test Coverage
The implementation includes comprehensive tests covering:
- ✅ Admin and Vault can call `receive_payment`
- ✅ Unauthorized callers are rejected from `receive_payment`
- ✅ Only Admin can call `set_admin` and `set_vault`
- ✅ Only Pending Admin can call `accept_admin`
- ✅ Only Admin can call `get_all_developer_balances`
- ✅ All rotation and update logic preserves state integrity

Run tests with:
```bash
cargo test -p callora-settlement
```
